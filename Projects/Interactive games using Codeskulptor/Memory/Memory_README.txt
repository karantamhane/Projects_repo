Summary:
	This game is designed to test one's memory. The aim is to pair similar cards. Game starts with cards face down and unexposed. Players can click a card to expose it. If a player exposes a card and immediately exposes its pair in the next turn, the cards are left face up for the rest of the game. If a match is not found during a turn, both cards go back to the face down position. Game ends when all card pairs are matched.
